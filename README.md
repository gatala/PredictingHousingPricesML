# Predicting Housing Prices 
Random Forest regression for predicting housing prices, using the Ames dataset. Detailed information about dataset, and data download links, can be found [here](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf).

The objective is to predict sale prices based on a data sample of ~ 2900 homes. The model achieves an R^2 score of 0.9, which shows how a simple Random Forest approach can be fairly accurate. Some effort on feature engineering improved the score by ~ 20%.
